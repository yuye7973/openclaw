# Capital Quotes

Use this skill when OpenClaw needs to inspect the local 群益 BrokerDesk quote status, latest quote event, full-universe completion, domestic/overseas classification, or strategy freshness gate.

## Scope

- Reads BrokerDesk state files only.
- Does not log in to 群益.
- Does not place orders.
- Does not read or store account passwords, API keys, or certificates.
- Reports quote event age/freshness from the latest official `SKQuoteLib.OnNotify*` event so stale events are visible.
- Treats `currentQuote` as fresh-only; `latestTradeQuote` is debug-only and may be stale.
- Uses the single health dashboard first when available so OpenClaw can consume one stable status contract.
- Treats stale, blocked, incomplete, or cooldown states as strategy-gate denial.
- Emits a runtime event for UI/runtime consumers without calling the broker API.
- Emits a UI-ready badge/action state so Trading Factory or other UI surfaces can display quote readiness without parsing broker files.

## Default Dashboard Source

The status gate reads this dashboard by default:

```text
D:\OpenClaw\.openclaw\quote\capital-automation-health-dashboard.json
```

Override with:

```text
OPENCLAW_CAPITAL_QUOTE_DASHBOARD_PATH
```

## Legacy Event Source

The reader uses this order:

1. `OPENCLAW_CAPITAL_BROKERDESK_STATE_DIR`
2. `BROKERDESK_STATE_DIR`
3. `D:\群益及元大API\BrokerDesk\state` on Windows

## Active BrokerDesk State Directory

When BrokerDesk is running from a staging build, OpenClaw resolves the active state directory dynamically and prefers the newest `D:\群益及元大API\BrokerDesk\dist-staging-*\BrokerDesk\state` folder that contains quote/event updates.

## Commands

## Ready Contract

The status gate reports `status=ready` and `strategyGate.ready=true` only when:

- Dashboard `healthStatus=completed`.
- Dashboard `allReadOnlyMonitorsReady=true`.
- Quote freshness status is `fresh`.
- Mapping and domestic/overseas classification are ready.
- Guard/cooldown is not active.

## Runtime Events

The event command maps status to:

- `ready` -> `capital.quote.ready`
- `stale` -> `capital.quote.stale`
- `blocked_1115` -> `capital.quote.blocked_1115`
- `blocked` -> `capital.quote.blocked`
- `incomplete` -> `capital.quote.incomplete`
- fallback -> `capital.quote.degraded`

## Quote Pump

The quote pump is the safe realtime bridge:

- Reads BrokerDesk `capital_latest_quote_event.json` and related state files.
- Rewrites OpenClaw quote reader state, quote status, and latest runtime event.
- Uses the paper HFT risk control `maxDecisionQuoteAgeSeconds` as the max quote age.
- Emits `capital.quote.ready` only when the latest BrokerDesk callback is fresh enough.
- Emits `capital.quote.stale` when the callback is too old.
- Never logs in, advances StartIndex, places orders, or writes broker state.

## Paper Automation Loop

Use `pnpm brokerdesk:paper-loop` as the heartbeat target for quote-driven trading simulation. The loop executes quote pump, quote architecture, paper HFT readiness, and paper simulator in order. It only writes OpenClaw paper state and learning records; stale quote, 1115 cooldown, invalid bid/ask, or failed readiness gates block paper intent creation.

Use `pnpm brokerdesk:paper-hft:burst` for HFT-like paper simulation. It runs short-cycle paper decisions at `decisionLoopIntervalMs`, stops on the first blocked cycle, and never logs in or writes broker orders.

Use `pnpm brokerdesk:paper-hft:trigger` as the safer OpenClaw scheduler target. It runs burst only for a new actionable SKQuoteLib callback and skips duplicate/stale/invalid quotes.

Use `pnpm brokerdesk:paper-hft:cron:check` after installing the OpenClaw native cron job. The check is read-only and verifies the scheduler contract without waiting for the next due run.

## Architecture Gate

The architecture gate verifies:

- Required `brokerdesk:quote:*` scripts exist.
- Required reader, status, runtime event, validation, and skill files exist.
- Skill guardrails still forbid login, order placement, credential storage, and stale quote strategy use.
- Generated status and runtime event schemas are stable.
- Status and runtime event safety flags stay read-only and no-login/no-trading.
- Runtime event type matches the normalized status.
- Status file and runtime event agree on status, strategy gate, and latest symbol.

## Paper HFT Readiness

The paper HFT readiness gate supports HFT-like automation only in paper mode:

- Reads quote architecture report, runtime event, and risk controls.
- Requires quote architecture `status=passed`.
- Requires runtime event `capital.quote.ready`.
- Requires strategy gate ready.
- Requires quote age to be within `maxDecisionQuoteAgeSeconds`.
- Requires live trading and broker writes to stay disabled.
- Produces paper intent readiness only; it never enables broker order writes.

## Paper Trading Simulator And Learning

The paper trading simulator is the first automatic learning loop:

- Reads paper HFT readiness, latest quote state, strategy config, and prior learning registry.
- Uses real quote fields such as `stockNo`, `close`, `bid`, `ask`, `qty`, and `decimal`.
- Creates a paper-only limit intent only when readiness is ready and bid/ask are usable.
- Writes skipped cycles when readiness is blocked or quote microstructure is unusable.
- Updates `capital-paper-learning-registry.json` from every cycle.
- Keeps `liveEligible=false` and broker writes disabled even when paper eligibility improves.

## UI State

The UI state command maps runtime events into a stable badge/action contract:

- `ready` -> success badge, strategy read-only context allowed
- `stale` -> warning badge, strategy context denied
- `blocked_1115` -> danger badge, API login and StartIndex progress forbidden
- `blocked` -> danger badge, guard investigation required
- `incomplete` -> warning badge, one read-only window only
- fallback -> neutral badge, quote state must be regenerated

The legacy event reader reports `ready=true` only when:

- BrokerDesk bridge is `connected`.
- BrokerDesk bridge `overallReady=true`.
- The latest quote event source is an official `SKQuoteLib.OnNotify*` event.
- `brokerActionRequired=false`.
- `currentBlockingCode` is empty.

## Validation Command

Validate the latest OpenClaw quote state:

```powershell
pnpm brokerdesk:quote:validate
```

Require a fresh quote event explicitly:

```powershell
node scripts\validate-capital-quote-state.mjs --require-fresh --max-quote-age-seconds 300
```

Accept a controlled broker-blocked state such as active `1115` without treating the reader as broken:

```powershell
node scripts\validate-capital-quote-state.mjs --allow-blocked
```
